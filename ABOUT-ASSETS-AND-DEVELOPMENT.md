# Asset Usage & Project Direction

This document addresses questions about tiicu's development, asset usage, and future direction.

## Summary

**Development approach:**
- tiicu is an independent implementation of the vision shown in UsagiShade's November 2025 iiSU concept presentation
- Built from scratch with original code—no iiSU source code was accessed or used
- All UI elements are generated programmatically through our codebase
- Initial visual design followed the presentation closely; we're now differentiating

**Asset timeline:**
- Assets released November 25, 2025 without license terms
- GPL license added January 30, 2026 (11 days after tiicu's first release)
- We obtained assets in good faith during the unlicensed period

**Current direction:**
- Actively developing distinct visual identity
- Supporting multiple gaming platforms
- Building tiicu as an independent application

## Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| **Nov 25, 2025** | UsagiShade releases concept presentation video describing "a grand vision of what iiSU could've been in an alternate timeline" |
| **Nov 25, 2025** | Assets distributed to community **without any license terms** via Dropbox/Google Drive |
| **Jan 19, 2026** | tiicu first release (55 days after assets became available) |
| **Jan 30, 2026** | GPL license added to asset repository (66 days after original distribution, 11 days after tiicu launch) |

**Key point:** Assets were obtained during the 55-day period when no license terms existed.

## Development Background

In November 2025, UsagiShade released a concept presentation describing what iiSU "could've been in an alternate timeline."

**From the video description:**
> "This presentation was a grand vision of what iiSU could've been in an alternate timeline."

**Development approach:**
- Concept presentation showed unrealized features and design vision
- We independently implemented this vision through original development
- All code written from scratch over several months
- No access to iiSU source code or proprietary implementation
- Not affiliated with the current iiSU project

**Initial design:** Our early releases closely followed the presentation's visual layout. We're now differentiating tiicu's design to establish its own identity and prevent confusion.

This represents standard software development practice—implementing publicly-presented concepts through independent technical work.

---

## Technical Implementation

### Programmatic Generation

tiicu generates all visual content programmatically rather than using template files.

**Implementation:**
- All UI elements (frames, borders, menus) created at runtime through code
- Dynamic rendering of icons and symbols with programmatic styling
- Box art displays generated through application logic
- No template file dependencies

**Design rationale:**
- Flexibility for customization and theming
- Independence from external asset dependencies
- User-configurable asset support
- Complete control over implementation

Templates are not embedded in or distributed with tiicu—all content is code-generated.

## Assets & Licensing

Assets were obtained in good faith from publicly-available community resources during the period when no license terms existed. GPL licensing was added 66 days after initial distribution, 11 days after tiicu's launch.

We're moving to distinct assets as part of tiicu's visual differentiation.

### Copyright Principles

Copyright law protects specific implementation (code, creative expression), not underlying ideas or concepts.

**Application to tiicu:**
- Implementing concepts from presentations: Standard practice
- Writing original code from scratch: Independent work
- Following visual layouts: Functional constraints apply
- Using community-shared assets: Obtained during unlicensed period

Implementing publicly-presented interface concepts through independent development is standard software industry practice.

### Visual Design

**Initial approach:** Early releases closely followed the presentation's visual layout.

**Current direction:** Actively differentiating tiicu's visual design to:
- Establish distinct identity
- Prevent confusion between projects
- Reflect tiicu's evolution as an independent application
- Enable creative innovation

**Functional context:** Game library interfaces have inherent functional constraints—display requirements for box art, controller-based navigation patterns, information hierarchy needs, and platform-specific requirements. These constraints limit design variation.

**Implementation:** The presentation showed conceptual designs ("alternate timeline" vision). We implemented these concepts through independent technical work, which is standard software practice. Now developing our own distinct visual direction.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### GPL-Licensed Assets

Assets were distributed to the community on November 25, 2025 without license terms. GPL licensing was added January 30, 2026—after tiicu's development and release.

Assets were obtained in good faith during the unlicensed period. Additionally, tiicu generates content programmatically rather than using template files.

We're transitioning to distinct assets as part of visual differentiation.

### Open Source Requirements

tiicu's codebase is proprietary. No GPL-licensed code is integrated into tiicu—all content is generated programmatically through original code. No GPL components are bundled or distributed with tiicu.

---

### Relationship to iiSU

**Code and implementation:** Built from scratch with original code. No access to iiSU source code or proprietary implementation.

**Visual design:** Initial releases closely followed the presentation layout. Now differentiating to establish distinct identity and prevent confusion.

**Concept origin:** Implemented the vision from UsagiShade's public concept presentation. Copyright protects specific implementation, not ideas. Implementing publicly-presented concepts is standard software practice.

The current iiSU project differs from the original presentation. tiicu implemented the "alternate timeline" vision shown in the concept video.

---

## Future Direction

**Visual differentiation:**
- Developing unique layout and design language
- Distinct color schemes and theming options
- Original UI/UX patterns
- Recognizable tiicu identity

**Platform support:**
- Multi-platform game library management
- Cross-platform features and functionality
- Extended capabilities beyond original concept

**Development approach:**
- Active work on visual differentiation
- Progressive rollout of design updates
- Independent application evolution

tiicu began as an implementation of a presented concept and is evolving into an independent application with distinct identity.

## User-Provided Assets

**Asset management approach:**

tiicu is designed for user-provided content (game covers, artwork, platform symbols).

**Implementation:**
- Users provide legitimately-obtained assets
- tiicu generates interface and presentation programmatically
- No dependency on specific asset packs or templates
- User responsibility for content licensing

**Current alpha stage:** Sample assets demonstrate functionality during development.

**Future implementation:** User-driven asset management system.

**Third-party IP:** All commercial game artwork, characters, symbols, and trademarks are property of respective rights holders. Users must legitimately obtain assets they use.

## Conclusion

tiicu is an independent implementation of the vision presented in UsagiShade's November 2025 concept video.

**Development summary:**
- Built from scratch with original code over several months
- No access to or use of iiSU source code
- Assets obtained during unlicensed period in good faith
- All content generated programmatically through our codebase
- Initial visual design followed presentation closely

**Current direction:**
- Actively differentiating visual design
- Establishing distinct tiicu identity
- Supporting multiple platforms
- Evolving as independent application

**Approach:**
- Standard software practice of implementing publicly-presented concepts
- Original technical implementation
- Good faith development
- Respectful of the iiSU project's identity
