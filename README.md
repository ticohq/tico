# tiicu

The first custom emulation frontend for Nintendo Switch — a controller-first, native C++ interface designed for performance, simplicity, and long-term portability.

----------

## What is tiicu?

tiicu is a multi-platform emulation frontend focused on delivering a console-quality user experience.

Instead of file browsers, configuration menus, and fragmented tools, tiicu provides a unified interface that automatically organizes games, manages assets, and launches embedded emulator cores with zero user configuration.

It is designed to feel like a real console UI — not a development tool.
